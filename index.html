    <p class="content">
        I'm a designer, maker, and thinker. <br> Born in Tucson AZ, I've been living in Portland since 2017. Im a student at Portland State University for Graphic Design, with a focus on rational design, 
        marketing and digital development. 
        Some of my passions include: Video games, painting, beat production, and clearly footwear.
        I’ve been with Docs for just over a year now, slingin’ boots on Burnside, and it would be amazing to have the opportunity to contribute more to this company.
        I have a strong drive to create, inform, and evolve, the public conversation. 
        I am the Founder and Lead Designer of Dead Cat Society Street Art since 2018.
        DCS has since been recognized within the community for leadership and creativity.
    <br>
<br>
I am the right fit for this job because I know more about the shoes and the brand than just about anyone else who might apply for this position. 
Additionally I have a lot of experience in many applicable fields; including visual literacy across multiple mediums, fast paced loose frameworking, digital communications. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
